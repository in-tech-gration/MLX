## Prerequisites | Data Formats

  Here are some of the most commonly used data formats. They are used to save information in a way that is readable both by humans and machines. The structured data stored in these file formats can be exchanged between systems and processed by programs.

  - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
  - XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
  - YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)
  - CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

  - Watch [**The Big 3 Programming Data Formats (JSON, CSV, XML)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkriaLlkByM){:target="_blank"} (8min)
  - Watch [**The Basics of YAML in Under 5 Minutes**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fbnyS_lHW4){:target="_blank"} (4min)

  - Read the sections about the CSV and XLSX formats in [this article](https://docs.parse.ly/whats-difference-html-csv-xcl/){:target="_blank"} and search for more resources on the Web about them.

  Feel free to explore and become familiar with other related data formats and their variations, such as TSV (Tab Separated Values), TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language) and other.

  <!-- TODO: Add sample data for each format -->
  <!-- TODO: Provide links to online converters between these formats -->
  <!-- TODO: Provide examples of where these formats are used -->
