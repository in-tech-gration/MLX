## [Introduction to TensorFlow](#introduction-to-tensorflow)

TensorFlow is an open source library for developing and training Machine Learning models. As an introductory session, we've selected this 19-minute [Introduction to TensorFlow.js - Intelligence and Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt3ZABW5lD0) video by [Daniel Shiffman](https://thecodingtrain.com/), which gives a very nice overview of the birth and evolution of the TensorFlow library, along with details about the different versions (Python, Java, JavaScript) that exist. 

Don't worry about the title, since in this video he talks about all the different versions of TensorFlow. Here are some of the concepts that you will learn after watching this video:

- What is `TensorFlow`?
- What are `Tensors`?
- In what programming languages is TensorFlow available?
- What are the different layers of abstraction in the TensorFlow library?
- What is `Keras` and where does it sit in the TensorFlow layers?
- What is TensorFlow.JS?
- How does TensorFlow utilize the CPUs and GPUs of the computer?
- Terms: `scalars`, `vectors`, `matrices`
- Libraries and frameworks mentioned: `Flask`, `PyTorch`, `Deeplearn.js`, `Theano`
