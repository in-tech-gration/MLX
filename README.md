## Prerequisites

  - Basic knowledge and familiarity with computers
  - Willingness to learn and dedicate as much time as possible on the course
  - Ability to work and collaborate with others as you will be working with a team
  - A good level of english language
  - Access to the Internet
  - Hardware requirements: minimum 8GB of RAM, an SSD Hard Drive and a pretty decent CPU 
  - Familiarity with Git, GitHub and Version Control (students can attend our Git Lessons)

## Description

  - Introduce students to Data Science and Machine Learning through real-life challenges.

  - Start by introducing the basic concepts of DS/ML, then using cloud DS/ML services such as IBM's Watson, Google's AutoML and other, that provide an easy and quick practical approach bypassing the complexity and math behind these technologies. At this point, we want the students to get hooked into DS/ML without the intimidating complexity and math behind these technologies.

  - As a next step, more concepts are introduced and a deeper understanding of the fundamental concepts follows. At this step we get to use libraries such as Keras, TensorFlow.JS and Sci-Kit Learn to dive into the next level of using DS/ML and solve more real-life challenges.

  - The third level of this course goes deeper into the math of DS/ML and touches the core of DS/ML code: we get to code a Neural Network from scratch and also use other algorithms (Decision Trees, K-Means, etc.) through the use of libraries such as TensorFlow and Sci-Kit Learn.

  - Advanced mathematics, more algorithms and extra challenges are provided as a extra-curriculum course that can be taken by graduates of this course in order to gain more experience and prepare themselves for coding interviews and challenges.

  - Languages & Frameworks/Libraries: Python, TensorFlow, Numpy, Pandas, Sci-Kit Learn, MatPlotLib
